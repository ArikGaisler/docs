## Overview

Creating an **earn** or **redeem** rewards transaction using the Benji Platform APIs involve the following simple steps : 
- **Obtain a valid access token** for the user creating the transacton by connecting the user to their loyalty reward partner by using the [Benji Connect SDK](/connect/introduction)
- **Get a short lived transaction token** from the Benji Platform by calling the [authenticate transaction API](/api-reference/endpoint/transactions/authenticate). Note that this token is valid for 10 minutes once created.
- **Call the create transaction endpoint** using the transaction token received form the previous step.
- (Optional) **Listen to any webhooks** to receive updates on the transaction lifecycle

<Tip>Checkout the Benji drop in components library for pre defined components that encapsulate this flow on your checkout pages</Tip>
