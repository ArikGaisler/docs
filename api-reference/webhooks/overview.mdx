### Webhook Flow
A typical webhook flow requires the following steps :
- **[Subscribe to an event](/api-reference/webhooks/subscribe)** and register your webhook endpoint. The Benji Platform will send any updates to this event to this endpoint using a **POST** request.
- **Listen to any webhooks** on your registered webhook event endpoint
- **Call the Benji Platform API** to retrieve additional information on the entity based on the event and the entity_type parameters in the webhook.
