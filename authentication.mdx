## General

The Benji platform uses a Bearer token to authenticate and identify all API calls. The bearer token is passed to the designated API using the Authorization header attribute.
<CodeGroup>
```Authorization: Bearer <token> ```
</CodeGroup>

### Token Types
There are 2 token types supported. The specific token type to be used is dependent on the API being used. The API documentation deliniates which token to use in which API.
<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion icon="github" title="Developer Access Token">
    This token is obtained when you are onboarded to the Benji Developer Platform. The developer access token is used for calls that are not user specific, do not perform any user related actions and are generally related to
    account level operations, user access token exchange flow and SDK initialization. 
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion icon="rectangle-terminal" title="User Access Token">
    This token is obtained once completing the user partner verification flow through the Benji Connect SDK. The instructions for obtaining the token can be found on the Benji Connect page.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion icon="rectangle-terminal" title="Refresh Token">
    This token is also obtained once completing the user partner verification flow through the Benji Connect SDK. The User Access Token above is valid for a certain period of time, which is represented by the "expires_at" parameter returned in the token exchange API (see API reference). Once a token expires, it can be refreshed using the token/refresh API (see API reference) with this referesh token.
    Note that when using an expired access token, the API will return a 401 response with the message "Invalid or Expired Token".
