## Installing the SDK

The Benji Connect SDK can be added to your application by including the SDK script in your html headers.

```html
<script src="https://d1ochlq3jv1msw.cloudfront.net/verifyapp/sdk/connect-sdk.js"></script>
```

### Initializing the SDK 

The SDK is initialized with the following parameters :

<ParamField body="token" type="string" required>
  This is the token that you created using the [Create Token API](/connect/create_token) in the previous step
</ParamField>

<ParamField body="onSuccess" type="callbak function" required>
  This is your callback function method, which will be triggered when a member has succesfully connected with a partner loyalty program
</ParamField>

<ParamField body="onExit" type="callbak function" required>
  This is your callback function method, which will be triggered when a member has closed the Benji Connect Modal. Note that this function can be whether the onSuccess callback has been called or not.
</ParamField>

<ParamField body="onError" type="callbak function" required>
  This is your callback function method, which will be triggered when a member encountered an error while connecting with their account.
</ParamField>

<ParamField body="onEvent" type="callbak function" required>
  This is your callback function method, which will be triggered for various events throughout the user journey within the Benji Connect flow.
</ParamField>


```javascript
let sdk = null;

function initializeSDK(token) {
    sdk = new AuthSDK({
        token: token,
        onSuccess: (token, metadata) => {
            console.log('Connect successful', token, metadata);
                      
            // Handle success event in your code, such as displaying a sucess message on your site and storing the returned token
           
        },
        onExit: () => {
            console.log('Connect flow exited');
            // Handle close Connect flow, such as log in your systen or disokay a message to the user
        },
        onEvent: (event, metadata) => {
            console.log('Event received:', event);
            //Listen and react to various events in the user flow.
        }
    });
}
```
