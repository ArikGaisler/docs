Once initialized , the Benji Connect SDK supports the following methods and events

## Methods

### open()
- This method opens the Benji Connect modal through the SDK. Typically tou would attach this method to an onClick function in your member connect flow.

```javascript
$('#connectBtn').on('click', function(e) {
        e.preventDefault();
        if (sdk) {
            sdk.open();
        }
    });
```

## Events

As a user goes through the Benji Connect flow, your application will receive the following events to the callback functions you specified as part of the [initialization flow](/connect/initialization) :

### onSuccess
Event that indicates a succesfull authentication between the member and a Benji loyalty rewards partner.
<Expandable title="onSuccess" defaultOpen="true">
Returns 2 values 
- **token** : A short lived access token to identify the user in the Benji Platform APIs. This token should be exchanged for an access token.
- **metadata** : Metadata giving you information regarding the user details and user loyalty status to be able to immediatley display or log in your system.
```javascript
{
   "status": {
      "num_of_rewards": 45000,
      "reward_status": true,
      "status_id": "********4156"
    ,
    "user": {
      "email": "test@withbenji.com",
      "first_name": "Test",

    }
  }
}
```
</Expandable>

### onExit
Event that indicates that the user has exited the Benji Connect flow
<Expandable title="onExit" defaultOpen="true">
This event does not return any return values. The onExit event can be triggered as a result of the following user actions : 
- The user has completed a full flow and has pressed close button at the end of the flow
- The user has exited the flow before completing a full flow by pressing on the close button or pressing outside of the connect modal
Note that the onExit will be called regardless of if the user has succesfully linked their loyalty account. The only event that indicates a succesfull connection is the onSuccess even above.
