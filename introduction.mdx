## Environments

Benji supports 2 dedicated environments :
- Production : https://\{service_name}.benji.com
- Sandbox : https://sandbox.{service_name}.benji.com

## Accessing the APIs

To get access to the Benji Platform APIs, contact your Benji representative to obtain an access key for 
the sandbox environment. Our technical support teams will setup a call with you to go through you use case to best understand how 
we can assist in your integration.
Once integration is complete, our team will review your API usage - and upon approval will grant you access to a 
production API key.

**Note : The sandbox and production environments are completely separate and isolated. All data
All your sandbox data will not be accesible through the production environment and vice versa, 
and your sandbox API key is not valid for production usage.**
